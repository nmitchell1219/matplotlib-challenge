# Matplotlib Challenge

In the Pymaceuticals challenge, I analyzed SCC treatment data using Python and Matplotlib, focusing on the drug Capomulin among others. I merged and cleaned datasets, calculated summary statistics, and generated visualizations like bar, pie, box plots, and scatter plots to assess treatment efficacy.
